AsciiBib provides an AsciiDoc-like syntax for entering a Relaton
bibliographic entry based on the Relaton data model
(similarly, to link:../relaton-yaml[Relaton YAML representation]).

AsciiBib is very useful when needing to define bibliographic items
inside an AsciiDoc structure, such as within Metanorma AsciiDoc.

NOTE: Metanorma uses AsciiBib syntax.
For those looking to enter bibliographic items in Metanorma,
this is the article you want to read.

There are two syntaxes for entering AsciiBib bibliographic entries.
