== AsciiBib

=== General

AsciiBib provides an AsciiDoc-like syntax for entering a Relaton
bibliographic entry based on the Relaton data model
(similarly, to link:../relaton-yaml[Relaton YAML representation]).

There are two syntaxes for entering in AsciiBib:

* link:../asciibib-nested[AsciiBib nested definition lists]
* link:../asciibib-path[AsciiBib path-style definition lists]

AsciiBib is very useful when needing to define bibliographic items
inside an AsciiDoc structure, such as within Metanorma AsciiDoc.

NOTE: Metanorma adopts AsciiBib syntax.
For those looking for Metanorma AsciiBib information, this
is the article you want to read.
