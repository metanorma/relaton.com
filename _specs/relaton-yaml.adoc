---

The following structure is in place for encoding `bibitem` as YAML objects. The structure has not yet been generalised to `bibdata/ext`, the flavour-specific extensions of Relaton.

NOTE: Relaton YAML can be used to represent bibliographic entries in Metanorma.

If an element in Relaton XML has attributes, the content of the element is represented in YAML
with a `content` key:

[source,xml]
----
<title type="main">Geographic information</title>
----

[source,yaml]
----
title:
  type: main
  content: Geographic information
----

Any elements with a cardinality of many can be represented as arrays, but
they can also be populated by a hash or single element. For example,
a Relaton title can have multiple titles, and multiple scripts; so
the following are equivalent:

[source,yaml]
----
title:
  - type: main
    content: Geographic information
title:
  type: main
  content: Geographic information
script:
  - Latn
script: Latn
----

In YAML, `on` is a reserved word, and thus cannot be used as a key.
`value` is used as a synonym for `on` in dates.

The structure below is given in YAML format:

[source,yaml]
----
# bibliographic item anchor, used to crossreference within document
id: ISO/TC211
# date record was created
fetched: 2019-06-30
# titles are an array, with a mandatory type and content, and optional format, language and script
